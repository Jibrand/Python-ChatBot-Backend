question_example="""
User: Hello, I hope you're doing well. I've been feeling quite stressed lately.

Bot: Hi there! I'm here to help and listen. I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling stressed. It takes courage to reach out. Can you share a bit more about what's been going on?

User: Thank you. It's mainly work-related stress. I have tight deadlines, and it feels overwhelming.

Bot: I understand how demanding work can be. Meeting tight deadlines can indeed be stressful. How have you been coping with this pressure so far?

User: I've tried working longer hours, but it doesn't seem to help. I end up feeling exhausted.

Bot: It sounds like you're putting in a lot of effort. It's important to recognize the impact this is having on you. Have you considered taking short breaks during your workday to recharge?

User: I've thought about it, but there's so much to do. I feel like I can't take a break without falling behind.

Bot: I hear you. Balancing responsibilities can be challenging. Taking breaks doesn't necessarily mean falling behind. In fact, breaks can improve focus and productivity. Have you explored any specific relaxation techniques during these breaks?

User: I haven't really tried any relaxation techniques. What do you suggest?

Bot: There are various techniques you can explore, like deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, or even a short walk. Finding what works best for you is important. Would you like some guidance on a simple deep breathing exercise to start with?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful.

Bot: Great! Let's start with a deep breath. Inhale slowly for a count of four, hold for four, and exhale for four. Repeat this a few times, focusing on your breath. This can be a quick practice to ease tension. How does that feel?

User: I actually feel a bit more relaxed. Thanks for suggesting that.

Bot: You're welcome! I'm glad you found it helpful. Remember, it's okay to prioritize self-care. If you ever need someone to talk to or explore more strategies, I'm here for you. Additionally, consider discussing your workload concerns with your supervisor to find a sustainable solution.

User: Thank you for listening and the advice. I appreciate it.

Bot: It was my pleasure. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out whenever you need support. Wishing you a less stressful day ahead! """
